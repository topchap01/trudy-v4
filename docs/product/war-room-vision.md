# Trudy War Room — Product Vision

## North Star
Deliver a single command centre that takes a promotion from brief to sell-in deck in one sitting. Trudy should think like a senior shopper strategist: interrogate the brief, cross-check category knowledge, surface creative leaps, and package the story as a leave-behind that closes the room.

## Experience Pillars
1. **Clarity first** — Every section answers “where are we in the process” without digging through raw outputs. Surfaced signals beat walls of prose.
2. **Grounded creativity** — Hooks, routes, and fixes are tied to research facts, operator cards, and retailer guardrails so ideas feel runnable.
3. **Instant handoff** — The export button should feel like printing the deck the team will present tomorrow. No manual patching, no hallucinated extras.

## Journey Flow
| Stage | Goal | Primary Inputs | Primary Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Brief & Research** | Understand the ask and the category realities. | Brief spec, research overrides, knowledge grid. | Structured snapshot, tensions, guardrails. |
| **Framing** | Align on the brand truth + shopper tension narrative. | Brief + research + founder notes. | Framing narrative, hook shortlist, handoff directives. |
| **Evaluation** | Pressure-test the idea exactly as briefed. | Framing meta, judge, knowledge grid. | Scoreboard, verdict, run-again moves. |
| **Creative Sparks** | Generate options without losing guardrails. | Brief + evaluation meta + operator cards. | Harness champion, agent ideas, operator tags. |
| **Routes & Synthesis** | Build comms/activation routes and commercial story. | Creative output, strategist prompts, benchmarks. | Routes, synthesis narrative, offer IQ. |
| **Export** | Pack a persuasive leave-behind. | All latest outputs, lens selection. | PDF/HTML/Docx deck (legacy or lens-specific one-pager). |

## Modules Snapshot
- **Brief / Research** — Show only the facts we believe. Overrides trump auto research. Every item needs provenance (Source: …).
- **Framing** — Keep the hero hook & hypothesis visible, plus the top guardrails (no hero prize, entry locked, etc.).
- **Evaluation** — Scoreboard + watch-outs. “Fix it” should feel like a two-line action list, not prose.
- **Creative Sparks** — Harness champ first, agents second. Highlight operator cards and retail line so ideas feel applied.
- **Routes / Strategist / Opinion** — Reduce duplicate narratives; focus on scenario plan, channel cadence, and KPI focus.
- **Judge** — Separate high-severity blockers from nits. Tie each to the export so governance status is obvious.
- **Export** — Lens picker (review vs improve vs reboot) plus legacy deck toggle. Each lens is a different editorial POV over the same snapshot.
  - **Mark’s Take stack** — Default export stitches three chapters: *Review as briefed* (celebrate the idea), *Sharpen with improvements* (3-pint tier, stagecraft, KPI lock), and *Reboot with alternatives* (bold reroute). Toggles in War Room can still show one chapter at a time, but the “Print deck” button should always feel like a full strategist story.

## Success Signals
- A strategist can walk into War Room cold and know within 60 seconds whether the idea flies.
- Creative Sparks outputs always include a retail line, odds/cadence, operator cards, and compliance variant when needed.
- Exported PDF is client-ready in one click; no references to phantom mechanics or other brands unless explicitly marked “inspiration”.

## “Feels Brilliant When…”
- Research feels bespoke: competitor list, tensions, and benchmarks are clearly the brand/category, not generic.
- Evaluation reads like a real strategist wrote it—balanced praise/critique tied to shopper reality.
- Sharpen lens suggests improvements that are doable tomorrow (e.g., “swap to NFC stamp card at POS” not “add AR metaverse overlay”).
- Reboot lens respects the briefed truth but pitches a bold alternative with retail-ready guidance.

## Guardrails
- Never blend in concepts from other campaigns unless flagged “Inspiration” and justified.
- Every recommendation must trace back to a fact (brief, research, guardrail, judge). If provenance is missing, suppress it.
- Prefer fewer, stronger insights over long dumps. If a module needs more than five bullets, we restructure.
