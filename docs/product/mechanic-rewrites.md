# Mechanic rewrites powered by MechanicRules.v1

## Scenario: Premium appliance launch (AU, durables)

| Mechanic | Recommendation | Felt-value reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cashback ($200, 8-week rebate) | “Cashback feels slow and admin heavy. Flip to bonus accessory or instant credit.” | MechanicRules says cashback has high sludge risk unless payout ≤48 h. |
| Gift-with-purchase (steam wand) | “Bundle the premium steaming wand (RRP $129) to cue quality + benefit congruency.” | GWP works when gift extends the core benefit (SAGE benefit-congruency study). |
| BOGO/bonus pack | “Not relevant for durables; skip.” | Zero-price framing wins in FMCG, not appliances. |

Fast copy tweak:

> “Buy Westinghouse induction this week and we’ll fit you out with the pro-steam kit (value $129) on the spot. No claim forms—just install and start pouring microfoam.”

## Scenario: FMCG instant-win vs price-off

| Mechanic | Recommendation | Felt-value reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instant win | “Publish ‘Winner every hour’ and ticker recent winners.” | MechanicRules → reinforcement cadence + natural-frequency copy. |
| Price-off 15% | “Invisible. Convert to left-digit drop ($5 → $4) or BOGO.” | Reference price research shows small % off is ignored. |
| Scarcity | “Use limited-quantity phrasing (‘Only 1,500 kits nationally’).” | Scarcity study: limited quantity > limited time on aspirational goods. |

Copy tweak:

> “Spin the lid, score instant wins every hour. Only 1,500 chef kits exist nationally—once they’re gone, they’re gone.”
