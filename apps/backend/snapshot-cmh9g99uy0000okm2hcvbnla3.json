      "content": "Where the Demand Is\n\nAutumn in Australia is a key period for beer consumption, particularly with events like St Patrick's Day driving pub attendance. The Australian liquor market is seeing a resurgence in on-premise consumption, with craft beers and authentic experiences gaining traction (Source: nielseniq.com). Guinness, with its strong brand presence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The focus is on increasing pint velocity and dwell time in pubs during St Patrick's week, aiming for a 12% increase in Guinness draught volume compared to last year (Source: brief).\n\nWho It’s For & What Stops Them\n\nThis promotion targets Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout enthusiasts who seek a guaranteed St Patrick's Day story. They value authentic Irish rituals and enjoy collecting Guinness merchandise, wearing it the same night (Source: brief). A key barrier is the cost of living pressures, which influence consumers to seek value in their purchases (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it meets consumer expectations and drives the desired increase in pint velocity.",

Why it works — The campaign leverages Guinness’ iconic brand presence and taps into the festive allure of St Patrick’s Day, fulfilling the consumer’s desire for authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed rewards (Source: brief). Where it breaks — The current mechanic of buying 12 pints for a T-shirt and racehorse share lacks immediate gratification and perceived value, a misalignment with consumers’ expectations for instant rewards and value amid economic constraints (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Fix it — Introduce an immediate and visible reward element such as the 'Golden Tap' surprise, ensuring each pint carries the potential for instant gratification, thereby enhancing consumer engagement and perceived value. Retailer reality — This activation promises increased foot traffic and pint velocity without burdening store teams, as the mechanics rely on digital consumer interactions and zero additional staff efforts, seamlessly integrating into pub operations. Tighten — Ensure every pint purchase triggers an immediate chance for a collectible or surprise win to enhance perceived value. Stretch — Implement a digital passport that logs pint purchases and rewards automatically, removing any redemption hassle. Hook upgrade — “Raise a Pint, Back a Winner” lacks the immediate reward clarity and excitement that consumers crave; emphasizing the aspect would better capture attention.

Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent.

          "priorOpinion": "As autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”",

Avoid mandatory receipt upload unless clearly warranted.\n- Perceived odds (non-assured value only): hero + visible ladder (instant wins and/or weekly moments) usually outperforms single mega-prize.\n- Retailer ops: zero staff adjudication; ship pre-packed POS; centralise winner comms & fulfilment.\n- Explain-in-5s: staff should pitch in one breath; avoid multi-step or technical terms.\n- Compliance (AU default): RSA/ABAC lines for alcohol; age gate; no consumption cues.\n- Fulfilment: travel prizes need buffers/concierge; publish timelines in T&Cs.\n- KPIs: name ONE primary success metric; align mechanic and value to it.\nUse these guardrails to reduce hassle, improve perceived value/odds where relevant, and de-risk store ops. Prefer simple one-screen flows, central adjudication, and clear staff scripts.\n\nContextual flags:\n- Hassle flag: brief suggests receipt/proof handling.

The Australian liquor market is seeing a resurgence in on-premise consumption, with craft beers and authentic experiences gaining traction (Source: nielseniq.com). Guinness, with its strong brand presence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The focus is on increasing pint velocity and dwell time in pubs during St Patrick's week, aiming for a 12% increase in Guinness draught volume compared to last year (Source: brief).\n\nWho It’s For & What Stops Them\n\nThis promotion targets Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout enthusiasts who seek a guaranteed St Patrick's Day story. They value authentic Irish rituals and enjoy collecting Guinness merchandise, wearing it the same night (Source: brief). A key barrier is the cost of living pressures, which influence consumers to seek value in their purchases (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it meets consumer expectations and drives the desired increase in pint velocity.\nPRIOR OPINION (authoritative; integrate lightly if still relevant):\nAs autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”\nRESEARCH SNAPSHOT (reuse-only; do not fabricate):\n{\"cashback_benchmark\":{\"sample\":1,\"typicalAbs\":42,\"maxAbs\":42,\"typicalPct\":null,\"maxPct\":null},\"prize_count_observed_total\":1,\"prize_count_common\":[{\"count\":2,\"freq\":1,\"share\":1}],\"recommendedHeroCount\":2}\nRESEARCH INSIGHTS (cite verbatim when useful):\n- Brand truth: Guinness has successfully leveraged its distinctive brand voice and consumer insights to become one of Diageo's strongest performers, with a 14% increase in net sales and a notable 24% rise in female drinkers.

The grain is mashed to convert starch in the grain to sugars, which dissolve in water to form wort. Fermentation of the wort by yeast produces ethanol and carbonation in the beer. Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and one of the most popular of all drinks. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent. Other flavouring agents, such as gruit, herbs, or fruits, may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, natural carbonation is often replaced with forced carbonation.",

          "priorOpinion": "As autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”",

Avoid mandatory receipt upload unless clearly warranted.\n- Perceived odds (non-assured value only): hero + visible ladder (instant wins and/or weekly moments) usually outperforms single mega-prize.\n- Retailer ops: zero staff adjudication; ship pre-packed POS; centralise winner comms & fulfilment.\n- Explain-in-5s: staff should pitch in one breath; avoid multi-step or technical terms.\n- Compliance (AU default): RSA/ABAC lines for alcohol; age gate; no consumption cues.\n- Fulfilment: travel prizes need buffers/concierge; publish timelines in T&Cs.\n- KPIs: name ONE primary success metric; align mechanic and value to it.\nUse these guardrails to reduce hassle, improve perceived value/odds where relevant, and de-risk store ops. Prefer simple one-screen flows, central adjudication, and clear staff scripts.\n\nContextual flags:\n- Hassle flag: brief suggests receipt/proof handling. Keep it one-screen and simple; only require uploads if value clearly warrants and OCR is seamless.\n- Compliance flag (AU alcohol): include RSA/ABAC lines, age gate, and avoid consumption cues.\n\nRuleFlex: KEEP\nApply guardrails strictly; prefer the simplest compliant path; no novelty for novelty’s sake.\n\nReminder: recommendations must land store-safe (zero staff burden), keep the hook premium and short.\nAssured-value mode: do NOT add prize ladders unless a separate overlay is explicitly briefed. Focus on clarity of value, speed, and transparent “how to claim”.\n\nPRIOR FRAMING (authoritative; do not restate):\nWhere the Demand Is\n\nAutumn in Australia is a key period for beer consumption, particularly with events like St Patrick's Day driving pub attendance. The Australian liquor market is seeing a resurgence in on-premise consumption, with craft beers and authentic experiences gaining traction (Source: nielseniq.com). Guinness, with its strong brand presence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The focus is on increasing pint velocity and dwell time in pubs during St Patrick's week, aiming for a 12% increase in Guinness draught volume compared to last year (Source: brief).\n\nWho It’s For & What Stops Them\n\nThis promotion targets Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout enthusiasts who seek a guaranteed St Patrick's Day story. They value authentic Irish rituals and enjoy collecting Guinness merchandise, wearing it the same night (Source: brief). A key barrier is the cost of living pressures, which influence consumers to seek value in their purchases (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it meets consumer expectations and drives the desired increase in pint velocity.\nPRIOR OPINION (authoritative; integrate lightly if still relevant):\nAs autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”\nRESEARCH SNAPSHOT (reuse-only; do not fabricate):\n{\"cashback_benchmark\":{\"sample\":1,\"typicalAbs\":42,\"maxAbs\":42,\"typicalPct\":null,\"maxPct\":null},\"prize_count_observed_total\":1,\"prize_count_common\":[{\"count\":2,\"freq\":1,\"share\":1}],\"recommendedHeroCount\":2}\nRESEARCH INSIGHTS (cite verbatim when useful):\n- Brand truth: Guinness has successfully leveraged its distinctive brand voice and consumer insights to become one of Diageo's strongest performers, with a 14% increase in net sales and a notable 24% rise in female drinkers.

Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it\nEvaluator JSON (authoritative fields; use to reason, not to quote):\n{\"hookLine\":\"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\",\"mechLine\":\"Buy 12 pints, collect stamps, redeem for T-shirt and racehorse share\",\"symbolism\":[\"Irish heritage\",\"St Patrick's Day\",\"Horse racing\"],\"proposition_hint\":\"Celebrate with Guinness and win!\",\"trade_priority\":\"LOW\",\"trade_table\":[],\"when_reflective\":true,\"run_again_moves\":[],\"majorPrizeOverlay\":null,\"cashbackHeadline\":null,\"cashbackBanded\":false,\"prizePresence\":\"NONE\"}\nOnly reference other brands or case studies when they appear in the supplied research competitor list; otherwise describe the mechanic generically (e.g., \"Inspiration: $10k home makeover – why it maps to Guinness\") and explain the bridge in one clause.\nEach run_again_moves item must be 6–12 words, brand-aligned, and actionable (e.g., \"Digitise passport stamp via NFC coaster\"). Never introduce prize pools or mechanics that contradict the briefed mechanic.\nHook candidates (draw from these; keep any “double pass” promise intact):\n- raise a pint, back a winner\n- graduate, claim back guinness.\n- rebate locked at graduation.\n- proof uploaded. rebate approved.\n- one receipt, one graduation, one rebate.\nWrite a concise evaluation using this exact template. Keep each section to two sentences or fewer unless noted.\nVerdict — one sentence that names the judgement and the cultural/commercial why.\nWhy it works — max two sentences tying brand truth, shopper tension, and timing.\nWhere it breaks — max two sentences naming the hardest flaws.\nFix it — max two sentences with the concrete plan to repair those flaws.\nRetailer reality — max two sentences showing the buyer why this earns easy range with zero staff lift.\nIf you recommend turning single tickets into double passes, state plainly that the winner count halves while perceived value doubles; never imply winner count stays flat.\nTighten — one sentence: the pragmatic tweak we ship now.\nStretch — one sentence: the bolder, still store-safe move.\nHook upgrade — one sentence that states why the current hook (“Raise a Pint, Back a Winner”) fails and what the stronger angle is.\nHook shortlist — list exactly five lines starting with \"- \" that evolve the candidates above. Each hook must reinforce the shared double-pass promise or instant win clarity; avoid inventing unrelated slogans.\nMeasurement — one sentence naming the single metric watched first.\nPack line — provide a 2–6 word line in quotes.\nStaff line — provide a ≤5 second staff script in quotes.\nRules: no other headings, no extra bullets, no filler. Cite sources inline (“Source: …”) whenever you quote data.",

The grain is mashed to convert starch in the grain to sugars, which dissolve in water to form wort. Fermentation of the wort by yeast produces ethanol and carbonation in the beer. Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and one of the most popular of all drinks. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent. Other flavouring agents, such as gruit, herbs, or fruits, may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, natural carbonation is often replaced with forced carbonation.",

        "priorOpinion": "As autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”",

The current offer lacks the perceived value necessary to drive the desired 12% increase in pint sales. A pivot is needed to align the promotion with consumer expectations for instant gratification and assured rewards. Guinness thrives on the theatre of its brand truths— the iconic two-part pour and the ritual of St Patrick’s Day. This campaign taps into the cultural timing of the festival, promising an authentic Irish experience. Yet, the barrier remains: consumers seek value amidst economic pressures. The Guinness T-shirt and racehorse share must symbolize more than a transaction; they must capture the essence of an unforgettable night. The promotion must pivot to a premium GWP with a clear RRP to resonate with the audience’s desire for certainty and value. Strategist insights suggest a shift to a digital passport system, simplifying the redemption process and enhancing engagement. This streamlined approach eliminates hassle, ensuring a seamless consumer flow. Immediate rewards such as “Golden Tap” surprises will drive engagement, and digital notifications will enhance the thrill of participation. The campaign’s tone should celebrate the Guinness ritual, ensuring the messaging is both premium and convivial. Retailers can rest assured; this activation promises increased foot traffic and pint velocity without extra staff lift. The digital passport system integrates smoothly into pub operations, requiring no additional adjudication. Ship pre-packed POS and maintain a concise staff script to ensure swift consumer interactions. The plan defends freezer space by enhancing brand loyalty and dwell time, crucial metrics for retail success. To tighten, ensure every pint purchase offers a chance for a collectible or surprise win, enhancing perceived value. Stretch further by implementing a digital passport that logs purchases automatically, simplifying the consumer experience.

          "content": "The call is clear: Guinness must recalibrate its St Patrick’s Day promotion to meet the assured value expectations of its audience. now is a good time; the Australian market is primed for on-premise experiences, with Guinness perfectly positioned as a disruptor. The current offer lacks the perceived value necessary to drive the desired 12% increase in pint sales. A pivot is needed to align the promotion with consumer expectations for instant gratification and assured rewards. Guinness thrives on the theatre of its brand truths— the iconic two-part pour and the ritual of St Patrick’s Day. This campaign taps into the cultural timing of the festival, promising an authentic Irish experience. Yet, the barrier remains: consumers seek value amidst economic pressures. The Guinness T-shirt and racehorse share must symbolize more than a transaction; they must capture the essence of an unforgettable night. The promotion must pivot to a premium GWP with a clear RRP to resonate with the audience’s desire for certainty and value. Strategist insights suggest a shift to a digital passport system, simplifying the redemption process and enhancing engagement. This streamlined approach eliminates hassle, ensuring a seamless consumer flow. Immediate rewards such as “Golden Tap” surprises will drive engagement, and digital notifications will enhance the thrill of participation. The campaign’s tone should celebrate the Guinness ritual, ensuring the messaging is both premium and convivial. Retailers can rest assured; this activation promises increased foot traffic and pint velocity without extra staff lift. The digital passport system integrates smoothly into pub operations, requiring no additional adjudication. Ship pre-packed POS and maintain a concise staff script to ensure swift consumer interactions. The plan defends freezer space by enhancing brand loyalty and dwell time, crucial metrics for retail success. To tighten, ensure every pint purchase offers a chance for a collectible or surprise win, enhancing perceived value. Stretch further by implementing a digital passport that logs purchases automatically, simplifying the consumer experience. The commercial payoff is clear: increased pint sales and consumer engagement during St Patrick’s week. This dual approach—immediate gratification and seamless digital integration—will drive the desired uplift in pint velocity. “Pour to Play, Win Today.” “Every pint could be a winner!”",

Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and one of the most popular of all drinks. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent.

The grain is mashed to convert starch in the grain to sugars, which dissolve in water to form wort. Fermentation of the wort by yeast produces ethanol and carbonation in the beer. Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and one of the most popular of all drinks. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent. Other flavouring agents, such as gruit, herbs, or fruits, may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, natural carbonation is often replaced with forced carbonation.",

    "framing": "Where the Demand Is\n\nAutumn in Australia is a key period for beer consumption, particularly with events like St Patrick's Day driving pub attendance. The Australian liquor market is seeing a resurgence in on-premise consumption, with craft beers and authentic experiences gaining traction (Source: nielseniq.com). Guinness, with its strong brand presence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The focus is on increasing pint velocity and dwell time in pubs during St Patrick's week, aiming for a 12% increase in Guinness draught volume compared to last year (Source: brief).\n\nWho It’s For & What Stops Them\n\nThis promotion targets Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout enthusiasts who seek a guaranteed St Patrick's Day story. They value authentic Irish rituals and enjoy collecting Guinness merchandise, wearing it the same night (Source: brief). A key barrier is the cost of living pressures, which influence consumers to seek value in their purchases (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it meets consumer expectations and drives the desired increase in pint velocity.",
    "evaluation": "Verdict — This is a NO-GO until the mechanics are recalibrated to meet consumer value expectations amidst rising cost-of-living pressures, ensuring the Guinness promotion aligns with the demand for unique and memorable experiences during St Patrick’s Day. Why it works — The campaign leverages Guinness’ iconic brand presence and taps into the festive allure of St Patrick’s Day, fulfilling the consumer’s desire for authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed rewards (Source: brief). Where it breaks — The current mechanic of buying 12 pints for a T-shirt and racehorse share lacks immediate gratification and perceived value, a misalignment with consumers’ expectations for instant rewards and value amid economic constraints (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Fix it — Introduce an immediate and visible reward element such as the 'Golden Tap' surprise, ensuring each pint carries the potential for instant gratification, thereby enhancing consumer engagement and perceived value. Retailer reality — This activation promises increased foot traffic and pint velocity without burdening store teams, as the mechanics rely on digital consumer interactions and zero additional staff efforts, seamlessly integrating into pub operations. Tighten — Ensure every pint purchase triggers an immediate chance for a collectible or surprise win to enhance perceived value. Stretch — Implement a digital passport that logs pint purchases and rewards automatically, removing any redemption hassle. Hook upgrade — “Raise a Pint, Back a Winner” lacks the immediate reward clarity and excitement that consumers crave; emphasizing the aspect would better capture attention. Hook shortlist — - “Sip and Score Big” - “Every Pint, A Winning Moment” - “Instant Cheers, s” - “Pour to Play, Win Today” - “Pint, Play, Prize” Measurement — Track increase in pint sales per pub during the promotional period. Pack line — “Pour to Play, Win Today.” Staff line — “Every pint could be a winner!”\n\nKey campaign-specific directives:\n• shopper tension: Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout fans are seeking memorable St Patrick's Day experiences, creating a demand for unique in-pub promotions and storytelling opportunities. (brief)\n• shopper tension: The cost of living pressures and inflation are impacting alcohol purchasing decisions, with consumers seeking value in their beverage choices. (drinkstrade.com.au)\n• brand truth: Guinness has successfully leveraged its distinctive brand voice and consumer insights to become one of Diageo's strongest performers, with a 14% increase in net sales and a notable 24% rise in female drinkers. (warc.com)",
    "opinion": "The call is clear: Guinness must recalibrate its St Patrick’s Day promotion to meet the assured value expectations of its audience. now is a good time; the Australian market is primed for on-premise experiences, with Guinness perfectly positioned as a disruptor. The current offer lacks the perceived value necessary to drive the desired 12% increase in pint sales. A pivot is needed to align the promotion with consumer expectations for instant gratification and assured rewards. Guinness thrives on the theatre of its brand truths— the iconic two-part pour and the ritual of St Patrick’s Day. This campaign taps into the cultural timing of the festival, promising an authentic Irish experience. Yet, the barrier remains: consumers seek value amidst economic pressures. The Guinness T-shirt and racehorse share must symbolize more than a transaction; they must capture the essence of an unforgettable night. The promotion must pivot to a premium GWP with a clear RRP to resonate with the audience’s desire for certainty and value. Strategist insights suggest a shift to a digital passport system, simplifying the redemption process and enhancing engagement. This streamlined approach eliminates hassle, ensuring a seamless consumer flow. Immediate rewards such as “Golden Tap” surprises will drive engagement, and digital notifications will enhance the thrill of participation. The campaign’s tone should celebrate the Guinness ritual, ensuring the messaging is both premium and convivial. Retailers can rest assured; this activation promises increased foot traffic and pint velocity without extra staff lift. The digital passport system integrates smoothly into pub operations, requiring no additional adjudication. Ship pre-packed POS and maintain a concise staff script to ensure swift consumer interactions. The plan defends freezer space by enhancing brand loyalty and dwell time, crucial metrics for retail success. To tighten, ensure every pint purchase offers a chance for a collectible or surprise win, enhancing perceived value. Stretch further by implementing a digital passport that logs purchases automatically, simplifying the consumer experience. The commercial payoff is clear: increased pint sales and consumer engagement during St Patrick’s week. This dual approach—immediate gratification and seamless digital integration—will drive the desired uplift in pint velocity. “Pour to Play, Win Today.” “Every pint could be a winner!”",
    "strategist": "Scenario — Assured theatre — Picture this: a bustling pub, the air thick with anticipation as each pint of Guinness is poured with the precision of a maestro.

The proof is in the pour, with a digital stamp on their Guinness passport confirming their reward. This isn’t just a drink; it’s a story they’ll tell long after St Patrick’s Day, with fulfilment as straightforward as a nod from the bartender. Scenario — Cadence burst — Imagine the pub as a stage, each hour a new act in the St Patrick’s Day saga.

Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent.

      "priorOpinion": "As autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”",

Avoid mandatory receipt upload unless clearly warranted.\n- Perceived odds (non-assured value only): hero + visible ladder (instant wins and/or weekly moments) usually outperforms single mega-prize.\n- Retailer ops: zero staff adjudication; ship pre-packed POS; centralise winner comms & fulfilment.\n- Explain-in-5s: staff should pitch in one breath; avoid multi-step or technical terms.\n- Compliance (AU default): RSA/ABAC lines for alcohol; age gate; no consumption cues.\n- Fulfilment: travel prizes need buffers/concierge; publish timelines in T&Cs.\n- KPIs: name ONE primary success metric; align mechanic and value to it.\nUse these guardrails to reduce hassle, improve perceived value/odds where relevant, and de-risk store ops. Prefer simple one-screen flows, central adjudication, and clear staff scripts.\n\nContextual flags:\n- Hassle flag: brief suggests receipt/proof handling. Keep it one-screen and simple; only require uploads if value clearly warrants and OCR is seamless.\n- Compliance flag (AU alcohol): include RSA/ABAC lines, age gate, and avoid consumption cues.\n\nRuleFlex: KEEP\nApply guardrails strictly; prefer the simplest compliant path; no novelty for novelty’s sake.\n\nReminder: recommendations must land store-safe (zero staff burden), keep the hook premium and short.\nAssured-value mode: do NOT add prize ladders unless a separate overlay is explicitly briefed. Focus on clarity of value, speed, and transparent “how to claim”.\n\nPRIOR FRAMING (authoritative; do not restate):\nWhere the Demand Is\n\nAutumn in Australia is a key period for beer consumption, particularly with events like St Patrick's Day driving pub attendance. The Australian liquor market is seeing a resurgence in on-premise consumption, with craft beers and authentic experiences gaining traction (Source: nielseniq.com). Guinness, with its strong brand presence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The focus is on increasing pint velocity and dwell time in pubs during St Patrick's week, aiming for a 12% increase in Guinness draught volume compared to last year (Source: brief).\n\nWho It’s For & What Stops Them\n\nThis promotion targets Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout enthusiasts who seek a guaranteed St Patrick's Day story. They value authentic Irish rituals and enjoy collecting Guinness merchandise, wearing it the same night (Source: brief). A key barrier is the cost of living pressures, which influence consumers to seek value in their purchases (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it meets consumer expectations and drives the desired increase in pint velocity.\nPRIOR OPINION (authoritative; integrate lightly if still relevant):\nAs autumn’s golden glow descends on Australia, St Patrick’s Day emerges as a beacon for Guinness, a cultural moment ripe for disruption. The Australian liquor market, robust and thriving, presents a stage where Guinness can dance its two-part pour and cascade its black-and-gold magic. With nearly 70% of Australians indulging in alcohol, the timing is impeccable to capture the hearts and palates of stout enthusiasts (Source: my.nzte.govt.nz). Today, Guinness meets its moment by weaving its brand truth into the fabric of St Patrick’s Day. The promotion promises more than a pint; it offers a story. The Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse are not mere giveaways; they are tangible tokens of pride and participation. Yet, the challenge lies in the high barrier of entry—12 pints—a steep climb in Sydney’s costly beer landscape, 60% pricier than New York (Source: news.com.au). The cultural timing aligns perfectly, but the execution demands a recalibration. Our improvement plan is clear: pivot to a more accessible mechanic. By shifting from 12 pints to a single-pint purchase, we democratize the experience. Each pint becomes a passport, a digital stamp collected with ease. This simplicity not only reduces hassle but aligns with the assured value ethos that Guinness embodies. The Evaluation suggests a premium GWP with explicit RRP, enhancing perceived value and engagement. For retailers, this streamlined approach is a boon. No additional staff lift, no complex adjudication. The digital redemption reduces in-store strain, and the cadence of engagement ensures freezer space is defended with consistent foot traffic. Retailers enjoy the buzz without the operational burden, driving a seamless flow from pour to prize. Tighten the focus: adopt the single-pint mechanic, ensuring every purchase is a celebration. Stretch the ambition: integrate NFC-enabled coasters for a touchless, tech-savvy experience. This innovation enhances the consumer flow, turning each sip into a seamless blend of tradition and modernity. The commercial payoff is clear: increased sales, heightened engagement, and a story that consumers wear proudly. “Celebrate with Guinness” “Join the team with every pint!”\nRESEARCH SNAPSHOT (reuse-only; do not fabricate):\n{\"cashback_benchmark\":{\"sample\":1,\"typicalAbs\":42,\"maxAbs\":42,\"typicalPct\":null,\"maxPct\":null},\"prize_count_observed_total\":1,\"prize_count_common\":[{\"count\":2,\"freq\":1,\"share\":1}],\"recommendedHeroCount\":2}\nRESEARCH INSIGHTS (cite verbatim when useful):\n- Brand truth: Guinness has successfully leveraged its distinctive brand voice and consumer insights to become one of Diageo's strongest performers, with a 14% increase in net sales and a notable 24% rise in female drinkers.

Keep cadence visible through consumer-facing messaging (pack, digital, social), not store labour. Never suggest staff-run amplification, kiosks, or in-store terminals — execution must run on consumer comms and zero additional store labour.\nBriefed entry mechanic: Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar. Keep the plan anchored in this flow.\nCREATE_UNBOXED / BRUCE focus:\n- Hook: Guinness Golden Taps & Tokens\n- Point: This concept leverages the excitement of surprise and the allure of limited edition collectibles. By introducing a 'Golden Tap' moment, it creates an engaging experience that draws customers into the mystery of potentially winning instant prizes and collecting unique tokens. This taps into consumer love for surprise and anticipation, enhancing the brand's festive appeal during St Patrick's Day.\n- Move: Deploy the 'Golden Tap' experience in high-traffic Irish pubs, using simple effects to create a glowing tap moment. Promote through digital alerts and an app to notify patrons of their instant win and collectible token, encouraging repeat visits and social sharing.\n- Risk: The main risk lies in ensuring the technology for the glowing tap and digital alerts works seamlessly to avoid customer frustration. Additionally, the prize and token distribution must be managed to maintain excitement and avoid stock shortages.\n- Odds & cadence: 1 in 50 pints unlocks a Golden Tap moment; winners receive instant prizes and tokens.\n- Retailer line: 'Try your luck with every pint! Will you find the Golden Tap?'\nResearch hints:\nBrand truth: Guinness has successfully leveraged its distinctive brand voice and consumer insights to become one of Diageo's strongest performers, with a 14% increase in net sales and a notable 24% rise in female drinkers. (warc.com) | Brand truth: Guinness' rewards program, 'My Guinness', offers exclusive access to experiences and merchandise, enhancing brand loyalty and engagement. (guinness.com) | Brand truth: Guinness has seen a significant 35% volume growth in Australia, driven by strong on-premise channel performance. (drinkstrade.com.au) | Shopper tension: Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout fans are seeking memorable St Patrick's Day experiences, creating a demand for unique in-pub promotions and storytelling opportunities. (brief) | Shopper tension: The cost of living pressures and inflation are impacting alcohol purchasing decisions, with consumers seeking value in their beverage choices. (drinkstrade.com.au) | Retailer reality: Pubs and hotels are priority retailers for Guinness, emphasizing the importance of on-premise strategies to drive pint velocity during St Patrick's week. (brief) Market cashback benchmark (sample 1): typical ≈ $42; max ≈ $42. Observed prize counts in current draws: 2 (100%). Recommended hero-prize count: 2 (perceived odds; invest remainder into breadth/instants).\nFraming (authoritative; do not restate, use to inform tone):\nWhere the Demand Is\n\nAutumn in Australia is a key period for beer consumption, particularly with events like St Patrick's Day driving pub attendance. The Australian liquor market is seeing a resurgence in on-premise consumption, with craft beers and authentic experiences gaining traction (Source: nielseniq.com). Guinness, with its strong brand presence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The focus is on increasing pint velocity and dwell time in pubs during St Patrick's week, aiming for a 12% increase in Guinness draught volume compared to last year (Source: brief).\n\nWho It’s For & What Stops Them\n\nThis promotion targets Irish-leaning pub regulars and stout enthusiasts who seek a guaranteed St Patrick's Day story. They value authentic Irish rituals and enjoy collecting Guinness merchandise, wearing it the same night (Source: brief). A key barrier is the cost of living pressures, which influence consumers to seek value in their purchases (Source: drinkstrade.com.au). Another mindset is the social drinker who wants to participate in the Guinness ritual without the hassle of complex promotions.\n\nCompetitor Map\n\nKilkenny and Murphy's are direct competitors, both offering Irish-themed experiences. Kilkenny focuses on enhancing the drinking experience with exclusive deals on glassware, while Murphy's leverages its Irish pub atmosphere (Source: kilkennydesign.com). Local craft stout taps also pose a threat, appealing to consumers seeking unique, locally brewed options. Guinness stands out with its iconic two-part pour and the theatre surrounding its consumption, which competitors struggle to replicate.\n\nBrand Lens (truth, codes to lean/break)\n\nGuinness is synonymous with the theatre of the two-part pour and St Patrick's Day rituals. The brand's rewards program enhances loyalty, offering exclusive experiences and merchandise (Source: guinness.com). Visually, the black pint silhouette and gold harp are distinctive assets. Verbally, phrases like \"Made of More\" and \"Good things come to those who wait\" reinforce the brand's premium yet convivial tone. The campaign should lean into authentic Irish experiences and guaranteed value promotions, avoiding generic beer promotions and overused clichés.\n\nThe Idea As It Stands\n\nThe current promotion involves buying 12 pints of Guinness, collecting stamps in a passport, and redeeming them at the bar for a Guinness T-shirt and a share in Sir Guinness the racehorse. This mechanic is designed to drive repeat visits and increase dwell time in pubs. However, the value proposition may need enhancement to meet consumer expectations for assured value.\n\nProposition Candidates\n\n1. \"Buy 12, Wear the Legend\" – Emphasize the immediate reward of a Guinness T-shirt.\n2. \"Sip, Stamp, Score\" – Highlight the simplicity and certainty of the reward.\n3. \"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\" – Connect the Guinness experience with the excitement of backing a racehorse.\n\nHooks (2–6 words)\n\nBack a Winner\nSip, Stamp, Score\nWear the Legend\nRaise a Pint\n\nWhat We’d Lean On\n\nThe campaign should leverage Guinness' distinctive assets, such as the two-part pour and the surge-and-settle cascade. The focus should be on creating a memorable St Patrick's Day experience that aligns with the brand's premium positioning. The assured value of the promotion must be clear and compelling to overcome cost-related barriers.\n\nHypotheses for Evaluation\n\n1. Increasing the visibility of the Guinness T-shirt as a reward will drive higher engagement.\n2. Simplifying the redemption process will enhance participation and repeat visits.\n3. Emphasizing the connection between Guinness and the racehorse share will create a unique narrative that differentiates from competitors.\n\nEntry/Redemption (from brief): Buy 12 pints of Guinness, collect stamps in your passport, redeem at the bar\n\nThe entry mechanic is straightforward, encouraging repeat visits and engagement with the brand. However, the perceived value of the reward should be evaluated to ensure it\nEvaluator JSON (authoritative fields; use to reason, not to quote):\n{\"hookLine\":\"Raise a Pint, Back a Winner\",\"mechLine\":\"Buy 12 pints, collect stamps, redeem for T-shirt and racehorse share\",\"symbolism\":[\"Irish heritage\",\"St Patrick's Day\",\"Horse racing\"],\"proposition_hint\":\"Celebrate with Guinness and win!\",\"trade_priority\":\"LOW\",\"trade_table\":[],\"when_reflective\":true,\"run_again_moves\":[],\"majorPrizeOverlay\":null,\"cashbackHeadline\":null,\"cashbackBanded\":false,\"prizePresence\":\"NONE\"}\nOnly reference other brands or case studies when they appear in the supplied research competitor list; otherwise describe the mechanic generically (e.g., \"Inspiration: $10k home makeover – why it maps to Guinness\") and explain the bridge in one clause.\nEach run_again_moves item must be 6–12 words, brand-aligned, and actionable (e.g., \"Digitise passport stamp via NFC coaster\"). Never introduce prize pools or mechanics that contradict the briefed mechanic.\nHook candidates (draw from these; keep any “double pass” promise intact):\n- raise a pint, back a winner\n- graduate, claim back guinness.\n- rebate locked at graduation.\n- proof uploaded. rebate approved.\n- one receipt, one graduation, one rebate.\nWrite a concise evaluation using this exact template. Keep each section to two sentences or fewer unless noted.\nVerdict — one sentence that names the judgement and the cultural/commercial why.\nWhy it works — max two sentences tying brand truth, shopper tension, and timing.\nWhere it breaks — max two sentences naming the hardest flaws.\nFix it — max two sentences with the concrete plan to repair those flaws.\nRetailer reality — max two sentences showing the buyer why this earns easy range with zero staff lift.\nIf you recommend turning single tickets into double passes, state plainly that the winner count halves while perceived value doubles; never imply winner count stays flat.\nTighten — one sentence: the pragmatic tweak we ship now.\nStretch — one sentence: the bolder, still store-safe move.\nHook upgrade — one sentence that states why the current hook (“Raise a Pint, Back a Winner”) fails and what the stronger angle is.\nHook shortlist — list exactly five lines starting with \"- \" that evolve the candidates above. Each hook must reinforce the shared double-pass promise or instant win clarity; avoid inventing unrelated slogans.\nMeasurement — one sentence naming the single metric watched first.\nPack line — provide a 2–6 word line in quotes.\nStaff line — provide a ≤5 second staff script in quotes.\nRules: no other headings, no extra bullets, no filler. Cite sources inline (“Source: …”) whenever you quote data.",
